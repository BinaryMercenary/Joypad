Streetfighter, Balloon Fight, Zelda, or any great retro rom deserve a proper Joypad. Wireless HID designed with Lakka in mind.

Warning - these bins can brick your device.  Take extreme care to ensure you have no loss of connection or power during flash!
Because I've tailored these bins to impersonate a logitech keyboard device (and it's pairing modes) please note the following:
<li>I make no claim on the IP of logitech nor their Unifying technology
<li>I do not in any way license or permit the use of this code for ANY commercial applications - and have no right to
<li>due to lack of FCC certifications or any testing for possible interference, do NOT use on/near aircraft or other such device
 
(Note, there is some intentional overlap near top row)
<li>The keyboard version (show map)
<li>The player-two rom is using mostly control keys (show map)

With minimal handling and no heat, the push-in quick-dev plates have been suprisingly reliable on the long term.
