the six top center dots are planned for the smaller arcade buttons
the right six dots are for the larger arcade buttons.
some small adjustments would be needed to place larger buttons in the center (even with only three there)
take extreme care when drilling the two center most holes - that support rib in the lego case is great but needs cut out *partially* at those points
